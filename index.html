<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I’m a technical program manager and product strategist with 25+ years across high-tech and retail, with a deep track record in global transformations and multi-million dollar program delivery. At ASML, I worked in a highly technical, semiconductor-manufacturing environment, partnering with engineering, operations, and field teams to scale complex systems worldwide, tripling support capacity in some areas while improving quality and first-time-right performance. I’m comfortable at the intersection of architecture, data, and execution: taking ambiguous problems, structuring them, and driving them to measurable outcomes.</p>


<p>I hold an MSc in Blockchain & Digital Currency and spend a lot of my time at the crossroads of AI, crypto, and financial infrastructure, designing architectures for AI-powered customer experience, building systematic trading and risk tools, and exploring Bitcoin’s role in the future of money. I’m the creator of CryptopiaHQ.com and a cofounder of QuarterlyIQ.com, an AI-driven investment intelligence platform that distills macro data, fundamentals, SEC filings, and sentiment into quarterly dashboards, alerts, and exportable signals for investors and teams. 
</p>

<p>On GitHub, you’ll mostly find me working on practical, outcome-oriented projects: quant and risk dashboards, PineScript indicators, macro and earnings analytics, and AI workflows that stitch multiple systems together. I care about clear structure, documentation, and making it easy for others to experiment, fork, and extend, turning messy real-world questions into models, tools, and automations that compound over time.</p>
